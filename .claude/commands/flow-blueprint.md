description: Create new .flow/PLAN.md for a feature/project from scratch
---

You are executing the `/flow-blueprint` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Create a brand new PLAN.md file from scratch for a new feature/project/bug/issue.

**ðŸ”´ REQUIRED: Read Framework Quick Reference First**

- **Read once per session**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 1-544 (Quick Reference section) - if not already in context from earlier in session, read it now
- **Focus on**: Plan File Template pattern (lines 134-207), Task Structure Rules (lines 47-107)
- **Deep dive if needed**: Read lines 2731-2928 for complete Plan File Template using Read(offset=2731, limit=197)

**Framework Reference**: This command requires framework knowledge to generate correct plan structure. See Quick Reference guide above for essential patterns.

**IMPORTANT**: This command ALWAYS creates a fresh `.flow/PLAN.md`, overwriting any existing plan file. Use `/flow-migrate` if you want to convert existing documentation.

**ðŸ’¡ TIP FOR USERS**: Provide rich context in $ARGUMENTS! You are the domain expert - the more details you provide upfront, the better the plan.

**Good example**:
