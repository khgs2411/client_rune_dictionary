description: Review all resolved subjects, suggest follow-up work
---

You are executing the `/flow-brainstorm-review` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Review all resolved brainstorming subjects, verify completeness, summarize decisions, show action items, and suggest follow-up work (iterations/pre-tasks) before marking the brainstorming session complete.

**üî¥ REQUIRED: Read Framework Quick Reference First**

- **Read once per session**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 1-544 (Quick Reference section) - if not already in context from earlier in session, read it now
- **Focus on**: Subject Resolution Types (A/B/C/D) (lines in Quick Reference)
- **Deep dive if needed**: Read lines 1167-1797 for Brainstorming Session Pattern using Read(offset=1167, limit=631)

**This is the review gate before `/flow-brainstorm-complete`.**

**Instructions**:

1. **Find .flow/PLAN.md**: Look for .flow/PLAN.md (primary location: .flow/ directory)

2. **Read framework documentation**: Find and read DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md (search in .claude/, project root, or ~/.claude/flow/)

3. **Locate current iteration**: Use "Progress Dashboard" to find current Phase/Task/Iteration

4. **Verify all subjects resolved**:

   - Check "Subjects to Discuss" section under current iteration's "Brainstorming Session"
   - Count total subjects vs ‚úÖ resolved subjects
   - If ANY subjects remain unmarked (‚è≥ PENDING), warn user: "Not all subjects resolved. Run `/flow-next-subject` to complete remaining subjects."
   - If all subjects are ‚úÖ resolved, proceed to next step

5. **Summarize resolved subjects**:

   - Read all entries in "Resolved Subjects" section
   - Create concise summary of each resolution:
     - Subject name
     - Decision made
     - Key rationale points
   - Present in numbered list format

6. **Show all action items**:

   - Extract all documented action items from resolved subjects
   - Categorize by type:
     - **Pre-Implementation Tasks**: Work that must be done BEFORE implementing this iteration
     - **Follow-up Iterations**: Future work to tackle after this iteration
     - **Documentation Updates**: Files/docs that need changes
     - **Other Actions**: Miscellaneous tasks
   - Present in organized format

7. **Categorize action items** (CRITICAL - Ask user to clarify):

   **The 3 Types of Action Items**:

   **Type 1: Pre-Implementation Tasks (Blockers)**
   - Work that MUST be done BEFORE starting main implementation
   - Examples: Refactor legacy code, fix blocking bugs, setup infrastructure
   - These become separate "Pre-Implementation Tasks" section
   - Must be ‚úÖ COMPLETE before running `/flow-implement-start`

   **Type 2: Implementation Work (The Iteration Itself)**
   - The actual work of the current iteration
   - Examples: Command updates, feature additions, new logic
   - These stay as action items IN the iteration description
   - Work on these AFTER running `/flow-implement-start`

   **Type 3: New Iterations (Future Work)**
   - Follow-up work for future iterations
   - Examples: V2 features, optimizations, edge cases discovered
   - Create with `/flow-iteration-add`

   **Decision Tree for AI**:
   - Extract all action items from resolved subjects
   - For each action item, ask yourself:
     - "Does this BLOCK the main work?" ‚Üí Type 1 (Pre-task)
     - "Is this THE main work?" ‚Üí Type 2 (Implementation)
     - "Is this FUTURE work?" ‚Üí Type 3 (New iteration)
   - **If uncertain, ASK THE USER**: "I found these action items. Are they:
     - A) Blockers that must be done first (pre-tasks)
     - B) The implementation work itself
     - C) Future work for new iterations"

   Present categorization in this format:

     ```
     **Pre-Implementation Tasks** (Type 1 - complete before /flow-implement-start):
     - [Task description] - Why it blocks: [reason]

     **Implementation Work** (Type 2 - these ARE the iteration):
     - [Action item 1]
     - [Action item 2]
     (These stay in iteration, work on after /flow-implement-start)

     **New Iterations** (Type 3 - add with /flow-iteration-add):
     - Iteration N+1: [Name] - [Why it's future work]
     ```

8. **Await user confirmation**:
   - Do NOT automatically create iterations or pre-tasks
   - Show categorization above
   - Ask: "Does this categorization look correct? Should I adjust anything?"
   - If user confirms Type 1 (pre-tasks) exist: Ask if they want them created now
   - If user confirms Type 3 (new iterations): Ask if they want them created now
   - Type 2 (implementation work) stays in iteration - no creation needed

9. **Show "What's Next" Section**:
   ```markdown
   ## üéØ What's Next

   **After reviewing**:
   1. If pre-implementation tasks were identified ‚Üí Create them in "Pre-Implementation Tasks" section
   2. If new iterations were suggested ‚Üí Use `/flow-iteration-add` to create each one
   3. Once all pre-tasks are ‚úÖ COMPLETE ‚Üí Run `/flow-brainstorm-complete` to mark iteration üé® READY

   **Decision Tree**:
   - Pre-tasks needed? ‚Üí Create them, complete them, THEN run `/flow-brainstorm-complete`
   - No pre-tasks? ‚Üí Run `/flow-brainstorm-complete` immediately
   - Need more iterations? ‚Üí Use `/flow-iteration-add [description]` first
   ```

**Output**: Comprehensive review summary with actionable suggestions, awaiting user confirmation.
