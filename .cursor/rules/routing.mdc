# Routing

## Organization
- Routing is managed with Vue Router.
- Router configuration is in [src/router/router.ts](mdc:src/router/router.ts).
- Route definitions are in [src/router/routes.ts](mdc:src/router/routes.ts).

## Conventions
- Define routes in [routes.ts](mdc:src/router/routes.ts) and import them into [router.ts](mdc:src/router/router.ts).
- Use route-based code splitting for large views.
- Place top-level views in [src/views/](mdc:src/views).

## Example
- [Match.vue](mdc:src/views/Match.vue): A top-level view routed by Vue Router.
- [Dictionary.vue](mdc:src/views/Dictionary.vue): Another routed view.
