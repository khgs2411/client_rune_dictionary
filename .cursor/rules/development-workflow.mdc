# Development Workflow

## Scripts
- Use `npm run dev` or `npm run serve` to start the Vite development server.
- Use `npm run build` to type-check and build the project for production.
- Use `npm run preview` to preview the production build locally.
- Use `npm run build:test` to run the test build script ([test-build.sh](mdc:compose/test-build.sh)).
- Use `npm run build:cleanup` to clean up builds ([cleanup-builds.sh](mdc:compose/cleanup-builds.sh)).
- Use `npm run deploy` to deploy the project ([deploy.sh](mdc:compose/deploy.sh)).
- Use `npm run reset-gh-pages` to reset the GitHub Pages branch.

## Formatting
- Use `npm run format` or `npm run prettier` to format code with Prettier ([.prettierrc](mdc:.prettierrc)).
- Use `npm run format:check` to check formatting without making changes.

## Type Checking
- TypeScript is used throughout the project. Type checking is performed as part of the build process.

## Environment
- Environment variables are managed in [.env](mdc:.env).

## Notes
- The project uses [Pinia](mdc:package.json) for state management, [PrimeVue](mdc:package.json) for UI, and [Vue Router](mdc:package.json) for routing.
- Custom Vite plugins are in [plugins/](mdc:plugins).
- Shell scripts for build and deployment are in [compose/](mdc:scripts).
